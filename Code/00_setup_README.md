# README for 00_setup.R
*Author: Zoe Mitchell*

This script initializes the environment for the EPA PM2.5 Monitor Verification project. It should be run before any other analysis scripts (01â€“03) to ensure all dependencies, directories, parameters, and functions are correctly set up.

---

## Purpose

- Clears the R environment.
- Installs and loads all required R packages.
- Sets working and data/output directories.
- Defines key parameters, color palettes, and file paths.
- Provides reusable functions for overlaying monitor and satellite data, and for generating all figures and tables used in the analysis.

---

## Usage

1. **Open `00_setup.R` in RStudio or your preferred R environment.**
2. **Run the entire script** (recommended: `Cmd + Shift + Enter` on Mac).
3. Proceed to run subsequent scripts (`01_*.R`, `02_*.R`, etc.) for data processing and analysis.

## Key Components

### Package Management

- Uses `pacman` to install and load all required packages:
  - Data wrangling: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `tibble`, `janitor`, `readr`
  - Spatial: `raster`, `sp`, `sf`, `tigris`, `smoothr`, `units`
  - Plotting: `ggplot2`, `cowplot`, `grid`, `gtable`, `scales`
  - Reporting: `stargazer`

### Directory and File Paths

- `main_dir`: Main project directory (edit if your folder structure differs).
- `data_dir`, `output_dir`: Subdirectories for data and output.
- `monitor_files`, `satellite_files`: Lists of file paths for EPA and satellite datasets.

### Parameters

- `years_monitors`, `years_satellite`: Year ranges for monitor and satellite data.
- `original_codes`, `updated_codes`: Method codes for original and updated monitor data.

### Color Palettes

- `cbPalette`: Colorblind-friendly palette for plots.
- `source_colors`: Named colors for different data sources.

### Functions

Reusable functions for:
- Overlaying monitor and satellite data (`overlay_monitor_satellite`)
- Plotting density, annual averages, annual differences, QQ plots, and scatter plots

All plots are saved to the `output_dir`.

## Notes

- **Edit directory paths** at the top of the script if your folder structure is different.
- All downstream scripts assume this setup has been run.
- For questions about data sources or structure, see the main project README.
